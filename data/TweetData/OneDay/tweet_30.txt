Hey @billbarhydt congrats on your @AbraGlobal success and moving to $LTC smart contracts but why not go one step further and use a faster, cheaper and more secure BlockChain like @DigiByteCoin #DigiByte does everything #Litecoin offers but better. Just an idea!

@RAPLPOSOW @InputOutputHK @IOHK_Charles @SIRINLABS @cryptosense @m1splacedsoul @LukeDashjr @manicode I'm steering clear of Turing-complete smart contracts. Until I find myself needing to pay for a countably-infinite set of cars, I consider it a liability.

ICYMI: Our latest post, "Defining Secret Contracts." Smart contracts need privacy to become useful. Here’s how Enigma’s secret contracts introduce privacy and enable powerful applications. A great explanation from our CEO and co-founder @GuyZys! https://t.co/pC4XILD9rN

@MadBitcoins @new_sentry @rogerkver You see the deconomy debate with Mow? When Mow (accidentally, I think) calls it Bcash, you can see Ver's face twitch. He becomes visibly upset.

It's so strange to me. Ver added "Cash" to the name. Bitcoin starts with a "B" what is the problem? Whats is insulting about that?
