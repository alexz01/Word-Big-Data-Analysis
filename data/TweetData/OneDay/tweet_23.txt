@cryptorangutang IMO $BTC is old tech and many other alts are doing a far better job. It doesn't change the fact that the entire market is currently dependent on the price of Bitcoin, though, and that as long as Bitcoin keeps tanking, so will almost everything else.

So Fortress sold ~$200M worth of bitcoin over the last few months. Mt Gox trustee sold ~$362M worth of bitcoin over the same time period.

So that's ~$562M worth of bitcoin dumped on the market since December between these two alone. I'm surprised price didn't drop lower tbh. https://t.co/jfid2nUktq
