Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers $NGVC Upgraded to “Buy” by ValuEngine https://t.co/AkMuQrkoUY
@ChrisKubby @simonsinek People do not “buy” what you do. If such was the case, there would be nothing to separate people / companies who sell the same product. 

However, I do agree with it’s about the customers why, but that’s Simon has said as all. Both whys need to align in some ways.
I got this question a lot since the thread I made.
For EU, we've no idea if people buy on PS4 or Vita cause the game goes as bundle.
For NA, ~20% of sales are on Vita. But if u check @PSNProfiles u can see trophy that completion rates are almost the same
