@worldnetdaily Can't sell to someone that can't afford to buy. Can't outsource the jobs/wages without destroying your own customer base.
@ithayla The base game has been on my gotta play list for awhile now, but still haven't had the opportunity to play it... I'm pretty cheap, so I always try to play before I buy. Haha.
