$BTCUSD BITCOIN 1HR CHART: The downtrend remains intact and I just don't see price making a move to break above the uppper black trend-line, at about 7635.26. Maybe we get a break above the red descending triangle but that lower black trend-line should be the focus, @ 6291.47. https://t.co/jQxSWKDvk8
I think that #Bitcoin itself cannot hold enough practical value to be the singular global reserve currency, even at 8 decimal places. 

And thus #Bitcoin Cash exists which effectively doubles the amount of value which may be held in reserve.
I sincerely hope that shitcoiners have learnt their lesson now, and get with the bitcoin program. Once enough people get this, the ensuing bitcoin price rally will be immense.
Should be a matter of time to see how low the price will get before the climb begins, and the true value is Bitcoin is revealed.
