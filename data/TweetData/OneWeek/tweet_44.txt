Current price of $Bitcoin is $6575.01 via #Chain
Looking for re-entering long @ $6490

Usually see a retrace back to the breakout point on low vol
It wouldn't be so good to see the price keep rising on low low

If I miss out will wait for the next pull back, no biggie. #nofomo here.

Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin!!!
@CobraBitcoin Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.  Nothing will ever change that.   Focus on building your network and less on mistating the truth.
From Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash fighters I see a childish behavior from both sides. BCH and BTC are both valuable as a market product. Accept that, look for sensible arguments that do justice to the both coins. It requires some use of intellect....

Bitcoin price in line to drop to $4000, whats your analysis Fuck boy?@parabolictrav
One major advantage of bitcoin cash #BCH over #BTC is the instant zero-confirmation transactions. It is huge for commerce and will never happen for #BTC because of RBF (replace by fees)...
4. $ETH Ethereum- is an open source blockchain decentralized protocol platform with functionality of smart contracts or called “autonomous agents”. ICOs are mostly ERC-20 token adherent. Now, upgraded to ERC-223, it is implemented to prevent accidental sends of tokens.

$BTC #bitcoin weekly followup: Either we get a big green candle or a reversal candle. The latter seems more likely given that the daily RSI didn't reset yet. This means that we can see a drop in price lower than last week's but a recovery to where we are now by next Sunday. https://t.co/sY1J7ATwOE

Im talking about the usage of XRP and FORECASTING its future price...it not impossible...if impossible existed in the crypto world...bitcoin would have never jumped to $19,000 at one point.
@flappening Ohhh I knew all along. My technical guess is that the only reason that bitcoin cash hasn't tanked is because there is a lot of people who don't even know they have it/people who lost their bitcoin and now that bitcoin cash is tied to a lost account. BOOM that's it
