That doesn't change the fact they have no working product. Their tokens are ERC20 tokens. If you compare with Icon ($ICX), Dragonchain ($DRGN) &amp; even $NEO that I don't like they all have working products by now.

@redbassett @BernieSanders My policy was the same in 2008, as it is now: after the convention, I support the candidate my party chooses. And, if the Democrats choose Bernie in 2020, I will hold my nose and vote for him. They'd be dumb to though, he's not a Democrat.
