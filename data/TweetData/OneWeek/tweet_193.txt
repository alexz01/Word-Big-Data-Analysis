@el33th4xor I stopped listening to this bozo when he claimed to be the inventor of bitcoin with no grounds for proof. Everyone should have just ignore this charlatan as soon as he came along. Now he is bitcoin cash’s Greg and doesn’t help the ecosystem at all.

In my opinion the current #bitcoin price action is healthy for long term investors. To me it’s an opportunity to start over with more relative intelligence.
@_ZXBC_ Why are we constantly having a TECHNOLOGICAL argument over bitcoin when we're engaged in a conflict of adoption, distribution and LEGITIMACY.  Calling Gucci Gucci-cash then making more or less the same luggage with a larger compartment doesn't make you Gucci.

$BTCUSD BITCOIN DAILY CHART: IMO, there should be no questions as to where the price of bitcoin is going =&gt; $5,920.72. There are no signs of strength that would suggest a move outside the downward descending channel and a price climb back above 11k/13k. Everything points down. https://t.co/uQl1QLGdYM
#ethereum is the most searched for #cryptocurrency surpassing #bitcoin in India.  The news alone should pump up the price so buy.  I doubt we will see it much lower.  #Eth is my fav #crypto because it uses smart contracts. Also possiblity of a hard fork. #cryptocurrencies https://t.co/7ntTAs2UKL
@PeeGoldberg2177 @binance Thats a good question. I think it will remain an underground coin with a massive cult following mostly used to buy drugs and stuff on Darknet. #Bitcoin #Litecoin #Ethereum #Monero #NEO #HODL

Today is the day Satoshi Nakamoto chose for his birthday. On this date, the Federal Government confiscated all the gold from US citizens.

The herds look at new technologies in three distinct phases: "looking down", "don't understand", "too late".

#Bitcoin $BTC is still at the first "looking down", "told you so", " bubble" stage. 

Herds will only jump on the bandwagon at "too late" stage. Don't be like herd. #HODL
