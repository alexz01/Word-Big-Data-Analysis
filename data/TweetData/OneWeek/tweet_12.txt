@EdVanDerWalt @NicTrades Bet if bitcoin price went up two thousand in a relatively short period of time , the trades wouldn’t have been cancelled ! Big bounce February 6 ( when bitcoin went under 6,000 and then bounced a thousand in twenty minutes or so ) , wasn’t cancelled.
Wyglada na to, ze Bitcoin Cash  (BCH) , stopniowo zaczyna tracic wsparcie niektorych gield. Kucoin wlasnie oglosil, ze wycofuje wszystkie laczone transakcje w ktorych mozna bylo kupic/sprzedac alttcoins uzywajc BCH.

This is a real wheat-from-chaff moment for #Bitcoin users.

Some people are all about the price. They don't want to storm the weather. They're out. 

For others, it was never about the price. Those folks are working just as hard as they always have.
