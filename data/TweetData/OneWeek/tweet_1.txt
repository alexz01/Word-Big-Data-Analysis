i hate being high bc i deadass cannot hear shit. i feel good but my ears don’t work &amp; i’m not sure if i just heard a garage door open or somebody get in an absolutely brutal car crash
NEW: @CMPD says high school victim hit by vehicle in Steele Creek was 15-years-old. Investigation reveals speed NOT a factor in the crash. Report points out roadway doesn’t have overhead street lights and that area of the road has no crosswalks or pedestrian signals. #CLT https://t.co/awHxCoKhJh
@awhitehead If I was a rich incumbent, I'd want the rule to be that a driverless car is 100% to blame for any crash (or 50% in the case of a collision between 2 driverless cars), with high statutory damages.
Zildjian A 20" Thin Crash and a Zildjian Dark K 18" Crash. $150 a piece or $300 for both. If interested DM me.
Two years later, the memory of Bates remains fresh, and the lessons learned from his crash carry on. One in five car crashes in Texas involved a teen driver in 2016. EVERY RIDER, EVERY RIDE. #TEAMBO <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0099> https://t.co/pHDk5imxV6
When the next crash happens, the government won’t be in a good position for bail outs or stimulating the economy. Record high debt and low interest rates leaves almost zero room for economic stimulus. https://t.co/I3PcP7CpVt
@NickInfoSec Come on, Neuromancer will be out next year... Or the year after that. Or the year after that.

Snow Crash, tho. On Netflix.

The Forever War.

Maybe The Diamond Age or Cryptonomicon, followed by Islands in the Net and The Difference Engine?

Man in the High Castle was produced...
@RTKDEA @observingstupid @JayPealer @SenSanders I don't care how U want to twist it. The fact remains that supply side is good for nothing if eventually no 1 has the $ to buy what has been supplied. The 99% need more $  -or we are going to crash. The recent tax cuts are a temp boost. But household debt is super high. Bad sign.
Greatest thing for right now you'll ever read, or not read. Your loss.

@BlueRisu Don't mess with Risu or she will use her dark magic to crash your car
@JoshGamnYoutube Ah I see well if they are announcing something they coud input a spyro demo code to announce it that way or it could be a new crash game I just font want to get my hopes to high .
@stroughtonsmith Just as a counterpoint to all of the High Sierra graphics issues: I've had exactly one crash on a 2011 MacBook Pro, and I switch between clamshell with an external monitor and standalone 2 or 3 times a day.

I've been afraid to update my family iMac though: still on Sierra there.
@henrikbengtsson @haschyle @jimhester_ Exactly. @haschyle If this were Olympic cycling, it's like an almost-free almost-trivial addition of a lock nut to avoid the occasional high-cost crash. It is not like a small improvement to helmet shape or clothing resistance.
@SGOqueen @WayneDupreeShow @BubbaJoeBaker I can't imagine how this all ends with this kid, his ego is so huge, he's running on a permanent ego high.  I don't wish anything bad to happen, I just think he is being puppeteered by the Left..he will either be backed forever or crash and burn from the hype. Not sure which.
@jeshkarae @JaredFPS @RufflesTV @MargoMagik @GFuelEnergy I have ADHD and I can't have caffeine or yeah I crash, gfuel is top down the best investment on a energy drink I've ever made. It doesn't have a horrible crash or high I love it
@ZeroVisionPhila @StuBykofsky When is @ZeroVisionPhila going to post the crash report for the pedestrian he hit on Roosevelt Blvd? He claims 90% of all crashes are due to drivers who are either high, drunk, or distracted. Which one are you?
@TrueBS Wearing helmets is generally a good idea.  But fact is they don't do much in a serious accident, Eg getting hit by a car or a high speed crash.  In fact, wearing the helmet likely gives a false sense of security -  at least it does for me.  So no need for such laws.
Hydroformed parts maintain a high quality compared to stamped or welded parts, meaning that crash performance and CAFE ratings have improved. #AHI #Hydroforming #Parts #Manufacturing #Mfg #Engineering #TubeHydroforming https://t.co/snuKzZhOU4
