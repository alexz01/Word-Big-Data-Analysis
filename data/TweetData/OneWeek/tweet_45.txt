#bitcoin  LIGHTNING HITS RECORD NODE COUNT, REACHES $70K CAPACITY Fresh statistics April 1 show that mainnet Lightning, which in March achieved several milestones to adoption, now has capacity for 10.476 BTC ($70,000). https://t.co/ajxWICvmD5 https://t.co/h6371vYLjX
@seriously211 @josephkunzler @Oncotastic You are right. Less miners would not lead to price increases. And as the OP said, if demand dries up miner interest would be further hindered. So unlike commodity markets that self-correct, bitcoin faces the risk of a death spiral.
$BTC #bitcoin weekly followup: Either we get a big green candle or a reversal candle. The latter seems more likely given that the daily RSI didn't reset yet. This means that we can see a drop in price lower than last week's but a recovery to where we are now by next Sunday. https://t.co/sY1J7ATwOE

A surge of #investor interest in #bitcoin and digital #currency has sore more than seven times in price this year. https://t.co/SUqX5Wa8M7
It's a self fulfilling prophecy.  Talks of death cross and #bitcoin correction, will drive down the price.   Until we hit $5-$6k, I don't see the market becoming bullish. 

If you are going to invest now,  use dollar cost averaging.
