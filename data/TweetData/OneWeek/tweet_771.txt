Gonna buy me some bacon
i'm not mad at @BobWeir anymore. yup. "it is finished" so, if i get backstage at @deadandcompany i'll just tell him in person. or maybe i'll buy a pit ticket and wave to him from the front-row, eh? i want to tell him what Barlow said to me before he died. IHS
@maxine_red Oh, exactly. When I bought my first house a couple of decades to go, I had 95% financing &amp; paid substantially more than rent would have been. I only got out through being lucky enough to be able to sell into the CA bubble &amp; pocket enough to mostly buy a cheap house elsewhere.
