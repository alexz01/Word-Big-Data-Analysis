6)  wasn't having it.  So we started to treat people's medical records as if they were classified documents.  

Incidentally that isn't cheap.  It forced healthcare providers to implement new systems, hire new people, buy new equipment  - and that is an ongoing expense.

Show their constituents that even if their rep doesn't want to hear from them, you do. https://t.co/7z7AFKjNVx
