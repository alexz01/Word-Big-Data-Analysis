@Bamabroker French reality star #Nabilla appeared on Snapchat on 12 January 2018 to encourage her fans to invest in #Bitcoin. "Even if you do not know anything about it, it makes money without investing much," she said, according to French financial newspaper Les Échos .
@elclondaje @CNN Zero hedge is a very reliable source of information and a perspective not found in many places.

I told my followers to buy, and when Bitcoin tripled in price, I told them to rethink and take some money off the table or cash out. Those that did are happy.

RT SatoshiLite "golferjosh It was already announced. Abra is using smart contracts on the Litecoin network."
@Altcoinbuzzio Bitcoin is in a strong downtrend channel. Assuming that it remains inside of the channel, the exact price of BTC, on May 1st, would have to be somewhere between 5875 and 0. However, there is major support at 3000. So, it's more likely to be somewhere between 5875 and 3000. https://t.co/aCBoW3bP8Z
@IOHK_Charles Does anyone have a link to a "hello world", beginners tutorial for writing smart contracts for Cardano? I couldn't find anything on the website.
