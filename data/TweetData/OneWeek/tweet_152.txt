Bitcoin price dropping is actually making me a believer again. Hopefully the craziness is over and we can get back to basics
@romik1940 Not very cheap. Just a bit more than x2. And that drop in January affected everything. Bitcoin is trading almost 3 times lower.And $XVG's price is lover just 4 times. $XLM dropped 2 times which is definitely not shitcoin. It will PROBABLY drop just a bit and will continue growth.

@HeyRhett I think timing sucked for @bitcoinprivate . After multiple #Bitcoin forks like Cash, Gold, Diamond, Platimum etc., exchanges became more vigilant about using Bitcoin name for quick cash grab.

@AnselLindner You might be right on #Bitcoin price/value.  But it will not be at the expense of capital fleeing gold.  Plenty of capital to go around...or yet to be created.
