@romik1940 Not very cheap. Just a bit more than x2. And that drop in January affected everything. Bitcoin is trading almost 3 times lower.And $XVG's price is lover just 4 times. $XLM dropped 2 times which is definitely not shitcoin. It will PROBABLY drop just a bit and will continue growth.

Indeed! What's the point of using #bitcoin peer-to-peer, without a third party, if the fees are high and the transaction will cost you a lot of money? Bitcoin Cash on the other hand has smaller fees and it is also very fast and secure. So I definitely support #BCH! #BitcoinCash https://t.co/ysgg1waBdg
