@ApathyEnds I've always had a bad work ethic, so it's hard to tell. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082> 
But in reality, my FU fund helps me work better. I stay calmer, and don't feel like I have to cling to my job. As they say, "hold on loosely, but don't let go."
@MJayDee82 Yeah. I’m not buying the Tapu Lele GX yet, but will buy Cynthia and full art Mars. Hopefully Planet Otaku will have something interesting. If not today, least I can check in June.
It’s still baffling to me that grown folks still buy stuff to fit in <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A6>
