Looks like #Bitcoin  is on a run to $7800, where we may break resistance and test the Kijun-Sen at $8800. Also, the Lagging Span line shows that past price isn't in trading range. Meaning we are in the clear for a descent rally. (credits zeffgotti) Retweet and comment #BTC https://t.co/k6APJJu4Yv

@H3dgi @SwoleOffCrypto @APompliano That's not accurate at all, look at the kilowatt use not the USD price... If you think the USD price has anything to do with Satoshis, Bitcoin or the Blockchain then you have clue what Bitcoin is.

@AnselLindner You might be right on #Bitcoin price/value.  But it will not be at the expense of capital fleeing gold.  Plenty of capital to go around...or yet to be created.
