Toronto’s Epic Housing Bubble Turns to Bust. After ballooning for 18 years, Toronto’s housing market, among the most inflated in the world, heads south with a vengeance, both in terms of sales volume and prices, particularly at the high end

@Ataraxia_Invest The only reason it doesn't concern me is because liquidity is improving every year. If you tried to sell a half billion last year, would have been way worse. 

Back in 2014, the US gov auctioned off only $15M worth of confiscated Silk Road bitcoin and it killed the price.

@Robertlin12 @BasicIncomeIMG @scottsantens Well for starters I only have a small picture on housing still. It's pretty easy to see how things like trade wars and price controls create distortions. Collision occurred before the 2007-2010 Credit and Housing Bubble. So it is reasonable to suggest it might still be occuring.
Good exchange founded!
