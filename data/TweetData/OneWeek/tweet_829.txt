@SuperForsyth @Perryll @CountryFirst50 @AAlhanti You know, I've often wondered how Hitler got Germans to go along with his crazy murderous schemes. The same for all the dictatorships around the world. After reading your BS, I see how it's done. People willingly buy into the BS. I hope you don't have access to guns.
